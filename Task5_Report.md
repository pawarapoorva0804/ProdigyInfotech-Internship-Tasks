Task 5: Checkout Automation Report
We automated checkout using Selenium with Python on the SauceDemo website.

Automated Steps:
1. Log in with correct credentials.
2. Add a single product in the cart.
3. Go to the checkout page.
4. Input checkout details (First Name, Last Name, Postal Code).
5. Submit order.

Observations:
• The checkout was successful and showed the success message "THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER".
• Proper validation messages were shown when fields are empty.
• Transitions on the site were seamless with no technical issues.

Recommendations:
• Add real-time form validation so that the users can right away see that they have left out fields before going ahead.
• Make the mobile cart layout more user-friendly.
