Task 2: Cross-Browser & Cross-Device Testing
We ran a test web page on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Key Findings:
• Layout Issues:
• Navigation menu was overlapping with the logo in Mobile Safari.
• In Firefox (desktop), buttons were not perfectly aligned.
• Broken Links:
• "Contact Us" link was returning a 404 error in all the browsers.
• Functionality Discrepancies:
• In Edge (mobile), dropdowns were not showing up.
• In Chrome (tablet), form validation messages were not showing up properly.

Recommendations:
• Make CSS media queries more responsive.
• Repair the "Contact Us" link to the proper URL.
• Repair the dropdown in Edge.
• Show uniform form validation messages on all platforms.
