Task 3: Automated Login Test Suite
We created an automated login test suite in Selenium using Python. The test suite included positive and negative test cases.

Test Results:
• Valid Login:
Submission of valid credentials routed users to the correct dashboard with a success message.
• Invalid Login:
Submission of invalid credentials resulted in the expected error: "Your username is invalid!".
• Empty Fields:
Submission alone triggered the error message, which shows that input validation is turned on.

Conclusion:
Login process is fine as it goes for valid, invalid, and blank inputs.
